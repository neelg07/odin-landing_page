### Project: Landing Page (TOP)

- I am creating an entire web page from scratch, based off of a design that is provided by The Odin Project's curriculum. 

- This will be my first "well-designed", self-made web page project.

- I will be utilizing the skills I have developed in HTML, CSS, and, in particular, the flexbox layout system in CSS. 


### Post-Project Statements: 

- Overall happy with producing a successfull web page

- Found my flexbox integration in CSS to feel more normal and easy over time.

- Having issues with format changes in the first section when shrinking the window 
    i.e. The image containing div and text containing divs overlap and the wrapping is uneven.

- Will revisit this project at a later date to make the page more aesthetically pleasing, as well as to add actual info to the page and personalize it to complete the space theme.
